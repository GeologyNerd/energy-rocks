+Welcome to the site!

My name is Marc Brunson.  My future goal in the job world is the geothermal research field.  Geothermal energy is an alternative energy which uses heated water from a source that can be a recycled source.  It's not widely available but the purpose of getting into the field is to help utilize the availability.
